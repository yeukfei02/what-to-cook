"""
User handoff tool for Strands Agent.

This module provides functionality to hand off control from the agent to the user,
allowing for human intervention in automated workflows. It's particularly useful for:

1. Getting user confirmation before proceeding with critical actions
2. Requesting additional information that the agent cannot determine
3. Allowing users to review and approve agent decisions
4. Creating interactive workflows where human input is required
5. Debugging and troubleshooting by pausing execution for user review

Usage with Strands Agent:
```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import handoff_to_user

agent = Agent(tools=[handoff_to_user])

# Request user input and continue
response = agent.tool.handoff_to_user(
    message="I need your approval to proceed with deleting these files. Type 'yes' to confirm.",
    breakout_of_loop=False
)

# Stop execution and hand off to user
agent.tool.handoff_to_user(
    message="Task completed. Please review the results and take any necessary follow-up actions.",
    breakout_of_loop=True
)
```

The handoff tool can either pause for user input or completely stop the event loop,
depending on the breakout_of_loop parameter.

    Hand off control from the agent to the user for human intervention.

    This tool allows the agent to pause execution and request human input or approval.
    It can either wait for user input and continue, or completely stop the event loop
    to hand off control to the user.

    How It Works:
    ------------
    1. Displays a clear indication that the agent is requesting user handoff
    2. Shows the agent's message to the user (should include context and instructions)
    3. If breakout_of_loop is True: Sets the stop_event_loop flag to terminate gracefully
    4. If breakout_of_loop is False: Waits for user input and returns the response

    Common Usage Scenarios:
    ---------------------
    - User confirmation: Get approval before executing critical operations
    - Information gathering: Request additional details the agent cannot determine
    - Decision points: Allow users to choose between multiple options
    - Review and approval: Pause for user to review agent's work
    - Interactive workflows: Create human-in-the-loop processes
    - Debugging: Stop execution for troubleshooting and manual intervention

    Args:
        tool: The tool use object containing the tool input parameters
            - message: The message to display to the user. Should include:
                * Context about what the agent was doing
                * What the agent needs from the user
                * Clear instructions on how to respond
                * Any relevant details for decision making
            - breakout_of_loop: Whether to stop the event loop after displaying the message.
                * True: Stop the event loop completely (agent hands off control)
                * False: Wait for user input and continue with the response (default)
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments
            - request_state: Dictionary containing the current request state

    Returns:
        ToolResult containing:
            - toolUseId: The unique identifier for this tool use request
            - status: "success" or "error"
            - content: List with result text
                * If breakout_of_loop=True: Confirmation that handoff was initiated
                * If breakout_of_loop=False: The user's input response

    Examples:
        # Request user confirmation
        handoff_to_user({
            "toolUseId": "123",
            "input": {
                "message": "I'm about to delete 5 files. Type 'confirm' to proceed or 'cancel' to stop.",
                "breakout_of_loop": False
            }
        })

        # Complete handoff to user
        handoff_to_user({
            "toolUseId": "456",
            "input": {
                "message": "Analysis complete. Results saved to report.pdf. Please review and distribute as needed.",
                "breakout_of_loop": True
            }
        })

    Notes:
        - Always provide clear, actionable messages to users
        - Use breakout_of_loop=True for final handoffs or when agent work is complete
        - Use breakout_of_loop=False for mid-workflow user input
        - The tool handles the technical details of event loop control
        - This tool only affects the current event loop cycle, not the entire application
        - The handoff is graceful, allowing current operations to complete
